Hugo ships with several [Built-in Shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#use-hugos-built-in-shortcodes) for rich content, along with a Privacy Config and a set of Simple Shortcodes that enable static and no-JS versions of various social media embeds.

&nbsp;
## YouTube Privacy Enhanced Shortcode

The youtube shortcode embeds a responsive video player for YouTube videos. Only the ID of the video is required, e.g.:

{{< youtube zYXudK0jyfI >}}
&nbsp;

## Twitter

You want to include a single tweet into your blog post? Everything you need is the URL of the tweet:

{{< tweet 877500564405444608 >}}
